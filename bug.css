The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are operator precedence issues. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 50px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 50%);` might not. The browser might interpret this as `(100% - 50%)`, resulting in an incorrect calculation.  Another less common issue is with nested `calc()` functions, leading to unexpected behavior unless carefully parenthesized.
